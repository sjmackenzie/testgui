RBE - Resource Based Economy

RBE is an implementation of the Venus Project created by Jaque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows. (http://www.thevenusproject.com)
It fuses the ideas of Handpassed (http://www.handpassed.com) and the Venus Project into a dynamic ad hoc delivery system, which tracks the available resources, needs,
and knowledge needed to solve the problems of the people.

How it works:
-------------
There are three important aspects to this software.
1) Human need tracking
2) Resource tracking
3) Path finding or ad hoc delivery
4) Education
